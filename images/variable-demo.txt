The Beginning


Teagan had gone to bed late because she was excitedly getting ready for her first day of high school. Even so it took her a long time to sleep because of her nervous anticipation of what awaited her. A new school, with new teachers, new classes, and especially new friends. Eventually she drifted into a fitful sleep.  At some point in the night she became dimly aware of a point of light in her room. The light seemed to grow brighter and slowly undulate. It seemed like a life like dream, but Teagan sat bolt upright in bed when a soft but strong voice call her by name. “Teagan, what gift do you desire?”  In stunned silence she thought, “What gift do I desire? This must be a dream.” Teagan thought for a minute, and then replied, “I don’t know, what are some options?”  “Three choices I will give you,” she said kindly. “First you may choose the gift of (link: "kindness")[\(set: $gift to "kindness")\(go-to: "Step1")\]. Second I offer the gift of (link: "knowledge")[\(set: $gift to "knowledge")\(go-to: "Step1")\]. Lastly you may choose the gift of (link: "immortality")[\(set: $gift to "immortality")\(go-to: "Step1")\]. It is up to you to choose.”

Step1


Just as she made her decision Teagan silently wondered if choosing <b>(print: $gift)</b> had been the best decision. As she pondered, the light quickly and steadily became smaller and smaller until it disappeared altogether.


What to do now? Unable to sleep anymore, Teagan climbed out of bed, opened her bedroom door and headed to the [[kitchen]].

kitchen


After walking down the hallway in her home, and turning right into the kitchen, she couldn't help but revisiting the decision she's made moments ago in selecting <b>(print: $gift)</b> as her "gift" from the light.
